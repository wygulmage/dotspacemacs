# My Spacemacs dotfile
This file was automatically generated by Spacemacs setup. I have since updated it to replace the Powerline with a simpler customized modeline, and added a bunch of hooks.
I'm using visual-line-mode with adaptive-wrap in Spacemacs, so without soft line wrapping it may look strange on Github.
